## Introduction

Please include introduction here.

## Loading of data

Let's load up our data. We have two main CSV files given from the Kaggle website:

```{r data}
dt_train <- fread("train.csv")
dt_store <- fread("store.csv")
```

## Taking a peek at the data

Let's first look at the data we have by looking at the first few rows.

### train.csv

```{r}
kable(head(dt_train), caption = "First few rows of train.csv")
```

### store.csv

```{r}
kable(head(dt_store), caption = "First few rows of store.csv")
```
